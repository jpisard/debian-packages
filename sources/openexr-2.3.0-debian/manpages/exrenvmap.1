.SH NAME
exrenvmap \- for creating OpenEXR environment maps. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B exrenvmap
.RI "[options] infile outfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B exrenvmap
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original
program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.

\fBexrenvmap\fP converts OpenEXR latitude\-longitude environment maps
into cube\-face environment maps or vice versa.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-o
produces a ONE_LEVEL output file (default)
.TP
.B \-m
produces a MIPMAP_LEVELS output file
.TP
.B \-c
the output file will be a cube\-face environment map (default)
.TP
.B \-l
the output file will be a latitude\-longitude environment map
.TP
.B \-w x
sets the width of the output image to x pixels (default is 256).  The height of
the output image will be x*6 pixels for a cube\-face map, or x/2 pixels for a
latitude\-longitude map.
.TP
.B \-f r n
sets the antialiasing filter radius to r (default is 1.0) and the sampling rate
to n by n (default is 5 by 5).  Increasing r makes the output image blurrier;
decreasing r makes the image sharper but may cause aliasing.  Increasing n
improves antialiasing, but generating the output image takes longer.
.TP  
.B \-t x y
sets the output file's tile size to x by y pixels (default is 64 by 64)
.TP
.B \-p t b
if the input image is a latitude\-longitude map, pad the image at the top and
bottom with t*h and b*h extra scan lines, where h is the height of the input
image.  This is useful for images from 360\-degree panoramic scans that cover
less than 180 degrees vertically.
.TP
.B \-d
sets level size rounding to ROUND_DOWN (default)
.TP
.B \-u
sets level size rounding to ROUND_UP
.TP
.B \-z x
sets the data compression method to x (none/rle/zip/piz/pxr24, default is zip)
.TP 
.B \-v
verbose mode
.TP 
.B \-h
prints these options
