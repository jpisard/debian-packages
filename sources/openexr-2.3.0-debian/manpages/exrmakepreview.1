.SH NAME
exrmakepreview \- for creating preview images for OpenEXR files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B exrmakepreview
.RI "[options] infile outfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B exrmakepreview
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original
program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.

\fBexrmakepreview\fP reads an OpenEXR image from infile, generates a preview
image, adds it to the image's header, and saves the result in outfile. Note
that the infile and outfile must not refer to the same file (i.e. the program
cannot edit an image file "in place").

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-w x
sets the width of the preview image to x pixels (default is 100)
.TP
.B \-e s
adjusts the preview image's exposure by s f-stops (default is 0).  Positive
values make the image brighter, negative values make it darker.
.TP 
.B \-v
verbose mode
.TP 
.B \-h
prints these options
